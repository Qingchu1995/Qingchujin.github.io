About me
======
I am a [Associate Research Scientist](https://roux.northeastern.edu/people/qingchu-jin/) at [Roux Insitute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/), Northeastern University. I received my Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 2021 with a focus on computational biology in cardiac eletrophysiology. My current research focues on development of mechanistic model-based mechine learning mehtods to undertsand the molecular and cellular mechanism of cardiac arrhythmias, irregular heartrate and clinical cardiac events. My research interest is using various computational approaches: machine learning and mechanistic modelign to unraveling the important biological and clinical problems.  
Prior to joining the Roux Institute, Northeastern University, I worked in Bristol Myers Squibb for a year as research investigator oon quantitative pharmacology modeling in cardiovascular field.
