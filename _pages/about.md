About me
======
I am a [Associate Research Scientist](https://roux.northeastern.edu/people/qingchu-jin/) at [Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/), Northeastern University. I received my Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 2021 with a focus on computational biology in cardiac electrophysiology. My current research focuses on development of mechanistic model-based machine learning methods to understand the molecular and cellular mechanism of cardiac arrhythmias, irregular heartrate and clinical cardiac events. My research interest is using various computational approaches including machine learning and mechanistic modeling to unraveling the important biological and clinical problems.  
Prior to joining the Roux Institute, Northeastern University, I worked in Bristol Myers Squibb for a year as research investigator on quantitative pharmacology modeling in cardiovascular field.
