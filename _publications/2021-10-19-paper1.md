# Author summary
An ectopic beat is an abnormal cellular electrical event which can trigger dangerous arrhythmias in the heart. Complex biophysical models of the cardiac myocyte can be used to reveal how cell properties affect the probability of ectopic beats. However, such analyses can pose a huge computational burden. We develop a simplified approach that enables a highly complex biophysical model to be reduced to a rather simple statistical model from which the functional relationship between myocyte model parameters and the probability of an ectopic beat is determined. We refer to this approach as arrhythmia sensitivity analysis. Given the efficiency of our approach, we also use it to demonstrate how uncertainties in experimentally measured myocyte model parameters determine the uncertainty in ectopic beat probability. We find that, with increasing model parameter uncertainty, the uncertainty in probability of ectopic beat first increases and then decreases. In general, our approach can efficiently analyze the relationship between cardiac myocyte parameters and the probability of ectopic beats and can be used to study how uncertainty of these cardiac myocyte parameters influences the ectopic beat probability.
